# nextjs-example
This repo contains a personal blog which runs on NextJS. It was bootstrapped by `next-create-app` and uses the [Blog Starter Kit]([Vercel](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/blog-starter-kit)) example from Vercel. I am currently adding custom components, routing, test ids, and more.

## Why choose an existing example to build upon?
For me, it's about speed and ability to get up and running quickly. I'm already familiar with React, Next, and GraphQL, so I just wanted a basic boilerplate to build from instead of having to install and wire up all of the dependecies manually. I'm currently hard at work on my personal business, so this affords me the opportunity to showcase coding proficiency (or at least that I won't go in and break everything immediately) with a low overhead.
